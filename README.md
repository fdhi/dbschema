# Project title and information
_Fault Displacement Hazard Initiative: Developing Database, Models, and Engineering Implementation Guidelines_

The FDHI project is a multi-year, community-based research project coordinated by the University of California initiated in 2018. The objectives of this project are to compile a modern database of coseismic fault displacements, develop models to predict the distribution and amplitude of potential primary and distributed displacements due to surface fault rupture, and develop engineering application guidelines for fault displacement hazard.

# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document the relational database schema for the Fault Displacements Hazard Initiative (FDHI) Database. The schema is best viewed via [the HTML documentation mode](https://fdhi.github.io/dbschema/).

# Built with

[SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.org/) v6.1.0

# Citation

Report and journal documentation are in progress as Sarmiento et al. (in prep. 2021)
